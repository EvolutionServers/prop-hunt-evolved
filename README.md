### A fork of Prop Hunt: ENHANCED by Wolvindra

_Prop Hunt: Infinity_ is a further improved version of _Wolvin's Prop Hunt: Enhanced_.<br>
The main change is to the taunt menu, which now supports essentially infinite taunts with less hassle than the original.

This fork is hosted on my server, *Props Beyond Infinity*, available at the domain below:<br>
