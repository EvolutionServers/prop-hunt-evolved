### A fork of Prop Hunt: ENHANCED by Wolvindra

*Prop Hunt: Infinity* is a further improved version of *Wolvin's Prop Hunt: Enhanced*.<br>
The main change is to the taunt menu, which now supports essentially infinite taunts with less hassle than the original.

This fork is hosted on my server, *Props Beyond Infinity*, available at the IP below:<br>
